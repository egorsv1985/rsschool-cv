## About me

I first started coding sometime in 2020 after taking a HTML course and from then, I was hooked.
I knew I enjoyed figuring out the logic behind creating applications but I was more interested in learning how to make it look pretty to users. That's how I started my career in front end development.
I am currently focused on finding my first dream job.
Thanks for reading ðŸ˜Š
